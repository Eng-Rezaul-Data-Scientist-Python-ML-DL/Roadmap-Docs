# Computer Vision Engineer Roadmap 2025/26

- Job Type: `Domain Specific`
- Opportunity: `Less Job Circular`

---
**Computer Vision** is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand `visual information` from the world, such as images and videos. It focuses on tasks like object detection, image recognition, facial recognition, motion analysis, and image generation, aiming to `replicate human vision capabilities`.

## **Understand the Role of Computer Vision Engineer**

### **What does a Computer Vision Engineer do?**
- Develop and deploy AI models for image and video analysis.
- Work on tasks like object detection, image classification, and image segmentation.
- Collaborate with hardware and software teams for optimized solutions.

### **Responsibilities**
- Building and fine-tuning deep learning models for vision tasks.
- Developing pipelines for large-scale image and video data processing.
- Integrating vision systems into real-world applications.
