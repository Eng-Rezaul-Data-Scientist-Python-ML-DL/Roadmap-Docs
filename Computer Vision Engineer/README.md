# Computer Vision Engineer Roadmap 2025/26

- Job Type: `Domain Specific`
- Opportunity: `Less Job Circular`

---
**Computer Vision** is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand `visual information` from the world, such as **images** and **videos**. It focuses on tasks like object detection, image recognition, facial recognition, motion analysis, and image generation, aiming to `replicate human vision capabilities`.

## **Understand the Role of Computer Vision Engineer**

### **What does a Computer Vision Engineer do?**
- Develop and deploy AI models for image and video analysis.
- Work on tasks like object detection, image classification, and image segmentation.
- Collaborate with hardware and software teams for optimized solutions.

### **Responsibilities**
- Building and fine-tuning deep learning models for vision tasks.
- Developing pipelines for large-scale image and video data processing.
- Integrating vision systems into real-world applications.

## **Step 1: Programming and Python Libraries**

### **Why Learn Python for Computer Vision?**
- Python offers powerful libraries for image processing and model training.

### **What to Learn?**
- **Python Basics:**
  - Variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, error handling, debugging, and OOPs.
- **Libraries:**
  - **OpenCV:** For image processing.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing results.

## **Step 3: Deep Learning for Computer Vision**

### **Why Learn Deep Learning for Vision?**
- Deep learning powers the majority of state-of-the-art vision applications.

### **What to Learn?**
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Architectures:
  - ResNet, VGG, MobileNet.
  - YOLO, Faster R-CNN (object detection).
- Image Segmentation:
  - U-Net, Mask R-CNN.
- GANs for Vision (StyleGAN, CycleGAN).

### **Resources**
- [TensorFlow Library:](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) For deep learning & AI.
- [PyTorch Library:](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) For deep learning & AI.
- [Learn OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Deep Learning Playlist (ANNs, CNNs)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKdU0fuY4OFdFUCFcUp-7VD4bLXr50hgb)
- [Basic to Advanced Computer Vision & GenAI](https://aiquest.org/courses/deep-learning-and-generative-ai/)
- [Hugging Face Vision Models](https://huggingface.co/models?other=vision): For advanced vision tasks.

## **Step 4: Projects**

### **Why Work on Projects?**
- Projects showcase your ability to apply vision techniques to real-world tasks.

### **Ideas for Projects**
1. Build an image classification model using CNNs.
2. Create an object detection system for autonomous vehicles.
3. Develop a medical image segmentation tool.
4. Train a GAN for image-to-image translation tasks.

### **Where to Find Data?**
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#download)

---

## **Final Note: Workflow Integration**
1. Preprocess image data using OpenCV or PIL.
2. Train models using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face.
3. Optimize models for performance and scalability.
4. Deploy and integrate vision systems into real-world applications.

By following this roadmap, you‚Äôll develop the skills needed to become a successful `Computer Vision Engineer`.
