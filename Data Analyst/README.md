# Data Analyst Roadmap 2025/26

## **Step 1: Python & Python Libraries**

### **Why Learn Python?**
- Python is the most versatile language for data analysis and manipulation.
- Widely used in data analytics for automating tasks, manipulating data, and creating visualizations.
- Also for statistical Machine Learning.

### **What to Learn?**
- **Python Basics**
  - Variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Libraries**
  - **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
  - **Pandas:** For data manipulation (DataFrames, cleaning data, handling dataset).
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For creating visualizations.
  - **Plotly:** For interactive visualizations.
  - **Jupyter Notebooks:** For organizing and presenting your code.

- Practice with Python datasets.

---------------------------------------

## **Step 2: SQL**

### **Why Learn SQL?**
- Essential for querying and extracting data from databases.
- Most companies store their data in relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.

### **What to Learn?**
- Basics: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- Intermediate: Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL), subqueries.
- Advanced: Window functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and optimizing queries.

### **Resources**
- Hands-on practice with sample databases (Chinook, AdventureWorks, or public datasets).
- Tools like MySQL Workbench, SQLite, or PostgreSQL.

## **Step 3: Statistics**

### **Why Learn Statistics?**
- Provides the foundation for understanding data, patterns, and trends.
- Core skill for hypothesis testing and decision-making.

### **What to Learn?**
- Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation.
- Inferential Statistics: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, t-tests.
- Probability: Probability distributions, Bayes' theorem.
- Correlation vs. Causation: Understand relationships between variables.

### **Resources**
- Khan Academy or online courses in statistics.
- Practice using Python (NumPy and SciPy) or Excel.

---

## **Step 4: Excel**

### **Why Learn Excel?**
- A widely used tool for quick data analysis and reporting.
- Versatile for creating dashboards and handling structured data.

### **What to Learn?**
- Basics: Data cleaning, sorting, and filtering.
- Advanced: Pivot tables, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and conditional formatting.
- Formulas: SUM, AVERAGE, IF, COUNTIF, etc.
- Data Analysis ToolPak: Regression, histograms, and other statistical tools.

### **Resources**
- Microsoft Excel online tutorials or Udemy courses.
- Practice creating small dashboards and reports.

---

## **Step 5: Power BI**

### **Why Learn Power BI?**
- A powerful business intelligence tool for creating dynamic dashboards and reports.
- Helps in visualizing and sharing insights interactively.

### **What to Learn?**
- Importing data from multiple sources.
- Building and customizing dashboards.
- Creating calculated columns and measures (using DAX).
- Designing interactive reports with filters and slicers.

### **Resources**
- Power BI's official tutorials.
- Practice by replicating real-world dashboards using sample datasets.

---

## **Step 6: Tableau / Data Studio**

### **Why Learn Tableau or Data Studio?**
- Both are user-friendly visualization tools widely used for creating impactful reports.
- Google Data Studio integrates well with Googleâ€™s ecosystem (e.g., Sheets, BigQuery).

### **What to Learn?**
- Tableau: Data blending, creating charts, and dashboards.
- Data Studio: Connecting Google Sheets, customizing reports, and sharing insights.
- Advanced: Adding calculated fields, creating interactive visuals.

### **Resources**
- Tableau Public (free) for practice.
- Google Data Studioâ€™s official tutorials.

---

## **Step 7: Projects**

### **Why Work on Projects?**
- Practical experience to apply all the skills learned.
- Helps in building a strong portfolio for job applications.

### **Ideas for Projects**
1. **Python:**
   - Analyze sales data to find trends and patterns.
   - Clean and visualize COVID-19 datasets.
2. **SQL:**
   - Create queries to analyze e-commerce sales or HR databases.
3. **Excel:**
   - Build a sales or financial dashboard.
4. **Power BI/Tableau:**
   - Design an interactive dashboard for customer segmentation or marketing performance.
5. **End-to-End Project:**
   - Use Python for data cleaning, SQL for data extraction, and Power BI/Tableau for visualization.

### **Where to Find Data?**
- Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, government datasets (e.g., data.gov).

---

## **Final Note: Workflow Integration**
1. Extract data using **SQL**.
2. Clean and manipulate it using **Python** or **Excel**.
3. Analyze the data using **Statistics**.
4. Visualize insights with **Power BI**, **Tableau**, or **Data Studio**.
5. Showcase results in a project or portfolio.
